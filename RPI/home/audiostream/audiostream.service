# The Wants and After statements above only wait for the device to
# receive an IP address from the DHCP server.  The code below verifies
# that the device has Internet access by pinging the well-known address
# of a highly available, globally accessible Google public DNS server.
# Try pinging 8.8.8.8 up to 10 times, one second apart.
# If ping never succeeds, systemd will consider the service to have failed.
